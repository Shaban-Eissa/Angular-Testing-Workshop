# Angular Testing Workshop

This project is a **comprehensive Angular testing workshop** that covers various testing scenarios, including:

- **Components** (Input, Output, Templates, Lifecycle Hooks)
- **Services** (Observables, HTTP Requests, Mocking)
- **Pipes** (Custom Pipes)
- **Directives** (Custom Directives)
- **Forms** (Reactive Forms, Validation)
- **Advanced Mocking** (Dependencies, HTTP Requests)
- **Integration Testing** (Component Interaction)

This project is designed to help developers understand and practice Angular testing in a real-world context.


## Features

This project demonstrates the following testing features:

#### **Components**
- **Input and Output**: Testing component inputs and outputs.
- **Template Rendering**: Verifying that templates render correctly.
- **Interaction with Child Components**: Testing parent-child component interactions.

#### **Services**
- **Observables**: Testing services that return observables.
- **HTTP Requests**: Mocking HTTP requests using `HttpClientTestingModule`.
- **Mocking Dependencies**: Using Jasmine spies to mock service dependencies.

#### **Pipes**
- **Custom Pipes**: Testing custom pipes (e.g., `CapitalizePipe`).

#### **Directives**
- **Custom Directives**: Testing custom directives (e.g., `HighlightDirective`).

#### **Forms**
- **Reactive Forms**: Testing form validation and submission.


## Prerequisites

#### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaban-Eissa/Angular-Testing-Workshop.git
   cd Angular-Testing-Workshop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run unit tests using the Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   ng test
   ```
   
This will open the Karma test runner in your browser, where you can see the results of the unit tests.
